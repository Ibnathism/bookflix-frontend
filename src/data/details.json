      "review": "“Ms. Dudley’s voice and tone are lovely, unadorned, genuine and vulnerable. I welcome the process of revisiting darkness and pain for the dual purpose of wrestling old demons and also helping lead others out of their own dark nights of the soul. I have no doubt that her story, so beautifully and authentically rendered, will inspire, soothe, and accompany others as they rebuild lives shattered by abuse.” - KIRKUS"
